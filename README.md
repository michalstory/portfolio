## About me
Hi!
My name is Michael. I started my adventure with IT in high school, choosing the IT Specialist profile.
Choosing this direction, I started my learning from getting to know the solid foundations of IT. Wanting to quickly become independent, I deviated from the career path in the IT world and followed a different path.
