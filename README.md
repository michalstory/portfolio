## About me
Hi!
My name is Michael. I have started my adventure with IT in high school, choosing the IT Specialist profile.
Choosing this direction, I started from getting to know the solid foundations of IT . Wanting to quickly become independent, I deviated from the career path in the IT world and followed a different path. Now I'm back, full of engagement, experience and new skills.
Currently I work in a large corporation in the fuel industry in the Department of Implementation and Development of Applications as a Technical Administrator for Applications.
